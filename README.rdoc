== Description

an http interface that doesn't suck.

if you're like me, your finger seize at the thought of using
net/http. it's practically inconceivable that we have this beast
while python has urllib/urllib2- and even c++ and java have
equally better interfaces for doing client-side http work.

the days of teeth-gnashing are over.

httprb is what ruby (and rubyists) always wanted out of net/http:
a ruby interface for communicating with the HTTP world. example:

  get 'www.google.com'
  # => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>

woah. wait. what about all this Net::HTTP.start(...) {http.get(...)}
nonsense? throw it out the window- this is Ruby, after all.

ok, so the simple case looks good. what about headers, parameters,
and all the rest of the HTTP world?

have no fear, check this out:

  post 'www.example.com/login' do |req|
    req.parameters << "username", "tom"
    req.parameters << "password", "password"
  end
  # => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>

getting better, eh? so relax, wipe the incredulity off your face- i
know you've been waiting years for net/http to get better. the wait
is over.

== Installation

while under active and early development, by which i mean until i
deem it worthy, grab the source and either install it manually or
run:

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/httprb*.gem

== Usage

this is sinatra-inspired (clearly). choose your verb, add a url,
and watch the sparks fly.

simple get request:

  get 'www.google.com'
  # => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>

you want the response object? you mean you actually want the body?
no worries, you're covered:

  res = get 'www.google.com'
  # => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>
  res.body
  ...

let's do a little header work:

  res = get 'www.example.com' do |req|
    req.headers << "x-some-key", "some value"
    req.headers << "x-some-other-key", "some other value"
  end
  # => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>

moving on to a post with parameters...

  res = post 'www.example.com' do |req|
    req.parameters << "some_key", "some value"
    req.parameters << "some_other_key", "some other value"
  end
  # => #<Net::HTTPOK 200 OK readbody=true>
